# weather

This project was much harder than i thought it would be. I seemed to do well in the class activities with the API but getting it started from scratch was another beast. Overall im happy to have atleast got the api to functon correctly and render differnt results on the page. Its not quite as pretty and neat as teh example in the homework. 

once I got my api to work it was relativley smooth sailing. I played around with it so much im not entirely sure what was wrong in the first place. over all the only requirment i feel as thoug i didnt hit was the part where i was supposed to get the info from local storage and render it in the searxh results div. I got the searches to save to local storage but i couldnt render it. 

As I mentioned this poject was much tougher than anticipated and I look forward to asking my teahcers for help in overcoming these bugs. It just goes to show you never know as much  as you think.
