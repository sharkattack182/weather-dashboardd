# weather

TTHis project was very insightful. During many of the activities I seemed to understand the APIs. IT took alot of working but i finally got them to work the way I needed. Once the API was working it was relativley smooth sailing. I needed some help to figure out how to get the UVI index but once I learned how ti find it, it was easy to place into the jumbotron. 

The one area I feel I really xoulnt get was reteiving the data from local storage and appending it to the div. I even aked for help with this but for some reason when I would add the logic I thought was correct it would break my API key and I would get an error message. I may have been using the same variable but I thought I was keeping them local. No matter what I changed it kept giving me the message until I deleted the function. I look forward to reviewing this with the staff and learning where I was going wrong.

Over all the project was tricky but do-able. I struggled less with the concepts of the API and more with the local storage side of it. This will give me alot to work with when I meet up with a tutor.
